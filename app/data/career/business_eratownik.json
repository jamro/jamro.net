  "description": "E-ratownik is a start-up that offers e-learning, legally recognized trainings for paramedics in Poland. As a co-owner I was supervising software development activities. Good understanding of SDLC and agile techniques allowed me to improve the efficiency of the team. I was also involved in product development. It was a good chance to apply knowledge gained during previous business & marketing courses. Listening of customer's feedback helped us to tweak the product and increase the sales by 15%.",
