The vast majority of them were software developers (Java, .Net, C++, Ruby, JavaScript). However, there were also other professions such as Quality Engineers, UX and Graphic Designers. Products developed within the department were also differentiated and covered among others: web applications, embedded systems and games. My job, as the Head of the Department, was to make sure that despite such variety, all teams are working efficiently and following best engineering practices.",
