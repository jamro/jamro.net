  "description": "Passion for technology and constant desire to learn new things led me to spend some free time on developing casual games. After a few months, my hobby turned into a well-working business. My role also has changed over the time from the developer to the manager what was complementary to my full-time job. Limex Games has released 12 casual games for mobiles and the web. All titles were played over 100 000 000 times worldwide and they were featured on top portals like Google Chrome WebStore, Kongregate or ArmorGames",
