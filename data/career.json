Krak√≥w engineering teams I have led were building a crucial part of that strategic shift - the Guidewire Cloud Platform. We quickly moved from a prototype phase to a mainstream product used by numerous customers to manage online services. My primary focus at that stage was to adapt to the new scale and quickly rising demand. I was responsible for growing the team, adjusting the organization structure, and fastening the cooperation across locations. The scaling also required alignment of some engineering aspects like the architecture of our product or SDLC process so we can keep delivering frequently but at a bigger scale. ",
