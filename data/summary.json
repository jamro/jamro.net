    "bio": "After two decades in tech, my journey has evolved from hands-on coding to leading high-performing teams. What’s stayed constant is my deep passion for engineering and a curiosity that drives me to explore how technology intersects with every part of a business. While I lead at scale, I remain hands-on, whether it’s diving into architecture reviews or exploring new tools. Today, I focus on building teams that are not only technically strong but also understand how to deliver impactful products shaped by bold ideas and clear business purposes."
